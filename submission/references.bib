  abstract = {Inland waters have received only slight consideration in recent discussions of the global fisheries crisis, even though inland fisheries provide much-needed protein, jobs, and income, especially in poor rural communities of developing countries. Systematic overfishing of fresh waters is largely unrecognized because of weak reporting and because fishery declines take place within a complex of other pressures. Moreover, the ecosystem consequences of changes to the species, size, and trophic composition of fish assemblages are poorly understood. These complexities underlie the paradox that overexploitation of a fishery may not be marked by declines in total yield, even when individual species and long-term sustainability are highly threatened. Indeed, one of the symptoms of intense fishing in inland waters is the collapse of particular stocks even as overall fish production rises\textemdash a biodiversity crisis more than a fisheries crisis.},

In a reference group of six hatchery fish that was reared 1\textendash 2 years in freshwater and 1\textendash 3 years in seawater, we found a significant increase in the Sr:Ca ratio, a decrease in the Ba:Ca ratio, and an increase in the Sr:Ba ratio in calcified growth zones during the transition from freshwater to seawater. In 10 wild adults captured in the Klamath River, California, combined evaluation of the Sr:Ca and Ba:Ca ratios provided a clearer understanding of fish movements than the Sr:Ba ratio, probably because wild fish have a more complex life history. The Ba:Ca ratio dropped significantly between growth zones 1 and 2 (ages 0.5\textendash 1.5), indicating a transition into saline waters, such as the Klamath River estuary. The Sr:Ca ratio increased slightly in the same location but attained the values found in reference fish held in seawater between growth zones 3 and 4 (ages 2.5\textendash 3.5). The Sr:Ca, Ba:Ca, and Sr:Ba ratios in growth zones 4\textendash{} 6 (ages 4.5\textendash 6.5) of wild fish were similar to those found in reference fish held in seawater and corroborated the results of previous physiological studies as well as the limited field data. These results demonstrate the usefulness of trace element analyses of green sturgeon pectoral fin rays and confirm an early age of entry into seawater for this species.},

We found an association between calcified structures and the availability of some element:Ca ratios in water. Among the measured element:Ca ratios, a strong correlation in Ba:Ca between outer edges of fin spines and otoliths was found (r 2 = 0.87, p = 0.0001), whereas Mg:Ca, Mn:Ca and Sr:Ca ratios were weakly correlated between structures (0.09 {$<$} r 2 {$<$} 0.20, 0.0006 {$<$} p {$<$} 0.02). Several ratios were significantly different among sites for otolith and spine edge (p {$<$} 0.05). Permutational multivariate ANOVA (p {$<$} 0.05) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) proved highly effective for characterizing differences in otolith and spine edge compositions between sampling sites (mean classification rates: 84.2 and 90.1\% for otolith and spine edge, respectively), suggesting that both structures can be used as habitat markers. To identify the possible contribution of multiple stocks to the different areas, we performed QDA for the complete last year of a fish's life. Classification rates were high for both structures, averaging 79.6 and 81.2\% for otolith and spine, respectively, suggesting the existence of new stocks in Patagonian waters. Spine chemistry seems to be an acceptable non-lethal advantage over otoliths to study different biological aspects of catfish.},

This study aimed to describe the indirect distinguish of first reproduction and habitat shift (transition from the pelagic to benthic environment), using the width of translucent and annuluses of the pectoral fin spine of two sturgeon species, Persian sturgeon, Acipenser persicus, and starry sturgeon, Acipenser stellatus. Interpretation of growth bands in pectoral fin sections was done objectively using direct reading of thin sections and image analysis. The results showed that changes in the profiles of translucent and annuluses occurred at the time of habitat shift and first reproduction. Females of both sturgeons move to the deeper waters earlier than males, which can be considered as strategy for the prolonged gonad development of female individuals. Estimated age at maturity for A. persicus (9~years for female and 7~years for male) was higher than A. stellatus (7~years for female and 6~years for male), which coincide with abrupt reduction in annuli width. Marks of habitat shift and first reproduction in the pectoral fin spine are species-specific characters and enable life history traits to be identified.},

Discrimination of Persian sturgeon Acipenser persicus ecophenotypics due to geographic variation was attempted based on calcified anatomical structures. Morphological characteristics of the pectoral fin spine were analysed in stocks from the eastern and western parts of the south Caspian Sea to explore if polymorphism could be discerned between regions within the Caspian Sea using ten key features which were measured. These key features were measured and used for multivariate analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA), discriminant function analysis and cluster analysis were used to visualize differences between regions, to follow any shape differences in the spines and to classify into the groups. On the basis of morphometrics between spines, 82.9\% of the individuals were correctly classified into one of the two regions. PCA showed the largest differences between the eastern and western regions were the density and arch of pectoral fin spine. Fish from the eastern region had a heavier and more curved pectoral fin spine when compared to those from the western part. The results from this study indicate that the morphological traits of pectoral fin spine of the Persian sturgeons can be used to discriminate between regions with a reliability rate of about 83\%. Therefore, the morphological differences are discernible in spite of the volume of artificial rearing and release of fish in the south.},

The means of the first and second annular radii were 806.6 \textmu m (27.2 SD) and 2,246.5 \textmu m (50.2 SD), respectively. The marginal increment analysis beyond the second OTC mark revealed a significantly smaller marginal increment for low feeding rate treatment (143.9, 11.2 SD) as compared to the high feeding rate one (269.0, 14.6 SD). The results indicate the slower growth rate in the fish fed the low feeding treatments seen in the pectoral fin spine formation, which can be used as an indicator of recent feeding history in sturgeon juveniles. The best daily feeding rate for great sturgeon of 2,460 g was determined to be 1.5\% body weight/day in this study.},

Fish from hatcheries used for stocking may therefore carry a natural intrinsic tag of their origin, which can be then later used for assessing the efficiency of stocking measures. This study investigated the potential of the elemental and strontium isotope (n(87Sr)/n(86Sr)) composition of fin rays of juvenile Persian sturgeons (Acipenser persicus) to determine their origin. Water and pectoral fin ray samples of twenty age-0 juvenile Persian sturgeons were collected from the largest hatcheries in the east and west of the Southern Caspian Sea region. The elemental content and the Sr isotope ratio in water were determined by (multi collector) inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ((MC) ICP-MS), while the elemental content in fin rays (Ba, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Sr) together with the Sr isotope ratio were determined using laser ablation split stream ICP-MS/MC ICP-MS. The elemental composition of Al, B, Ba, Ca, Cu, Fe, Ga, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Pb, Rb, Sr, Tl, U and Zn and the Sr isotope ratio of water differed between the investigated hatcheries from the east and west of the Southern Caspian Sea region. Fin rays reflected the elemental (Sr, Ba and Mn) and the Sr isotope composition of pool water of their hatchery of origin. A factor analysis yielded one main factor (high in Sr content and in the n(87Sr)/n(86Sr) ratio and low in Ba and Mn content) discriminating fin ray samples between sites explaining 86 \% of the variation. A discrimination analysis by cross-validated classification yielded 100 \% correct assignments of fin ray samples to the hatchery sites using all different parameter combinations. These results suggested that the Sr, Ba Mn elemental and Sr isotope composition of fin rays can be used for the determination of the source hatchery of stocked fish. This represents a valuable tool for evaluation restocking measures of Persian sturgeons in the Southern Caspian Sea region.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the life history and habitat requirements of sturgeons, alternatives for their protection and restoration in North America, and a typical protection and enhancement program in the Columbia River. Sturgeon are uniquely adapted to mainstem river systems which are characterized by their large scale, diverse habitats, and dynamic nature. Adaptations include mobility, opportunistic food habits, delayed maturation, longevity, and high individual fecundity. Unfortunately these life history characteristics are now a handicap for sturgeon because of fragmentation and destruction of their habitat. A variety of habitat-related alternatives for the protection and restoration of sturgeon were identified in a review of the literature and a survey of sturgeon biologists and managers throughout North America. However, harvest restrictions and supplementation using aquaculture are much more likely to be implemented than the system-wide measures needed to affect sturgeon habitat. A program for white sturgeon protection and enhancement in the Columbia River is a typical case where harvest management and supplementation measures are being used to optimize production of existing habitat but significant changes in water use and hydropower operation are needed to restore sturgeon to historic levels of production.}

  abstract = {The fish otolith (earstone) has long been known as a timekeeper, but interest in its use as a metabolically inert environmental recorder has accelerated in recent years. In part due to technological advances, applications such as stock identification, determination of migration pathways, reconstruction of temperature and salinity history, age validation, detection of anadromy, use as a natural tag and chemical mass marking have been developed, some of which are difficult or impossible to implement using alternative techniques. Microsampling and the latest advances in beam-based probes allow many elemental assays to be coupled with daily or annual growth increments, thus providing a detailed chronological record of the environment. However, few workers have critically assessed the assumptions upon which the environmental reconstructions are based, or considered the possibility that elemental incorporation into the otolith may proceed differently than that into other calcified structures. This paper reviews current applications and their assumptions and suggests future directions. Particular attention is given to the premises that the elemental and isotopic composition of the otolith reflects that of the environment, and the effect of physiological filters on the resulting composition. The roles of temperature, elemental uptake into the fish and the process of otolith crystallization are also assessed. Drawing upon recent advances in geochemistry and paleoclimate research as points of contrast, it appears that not all applications of otolith chemistry are firmly based, although others are destined to become powerful and perhaps routine tools for the mainstream fish biologist.},

Synoptic research vessel surveys carried out each January between 1994 and 1997 documented dense aggregations of cod along both flanks of the Laurentian Channel in each year, with estimated biomasses exceeding 100 000 metric tons. Using the trace element composition of the otolith ("otolith elemental fingerprint") as a natural tag, we found members of four populations to be present on the overwintering grounds in significant numbers, yet large-scale mixing among the populations was minimal. Individual trawl samples were often composed of a single population, suggesting that population integrity was maintained at a scale of {$<$}20 km. Cod from the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence dominated the population composition along the southern flank of the Channel, while cod from the northern Gulf dominated the northern flank; the distributions of both of these populations extended well to the east of their summer habitats and were remarkably similar across years. There was no evidence of large-scale mixing across the Channel. In light of the substantive migration of northern Gulf cod into the management area for the southern Newfoundland population, fishing effort off southern Newfoundland has the potential to reduce the size of the northern Gulf population.},

Telemetry studies on sturgeons have focused mainly on large individuals; research on juveniles is scarce and tagging-effect studies on young-of-the-year are needed considering the species threatened status and their poorly known freshwater ecology. To study the feasibility of acoustic tagging in juveniles, a trial on Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii) was carried out. The purpose of our study was to assess the effects of intraperitoneal acoustic tagging on survival, growth, swimming behavior and tag retention in young-of-the-year sturgeons. Fifty fish were tagged with dummy-acoustic transmitters (1.07 \texttimes{} 0.54 \texttimes{} 0.31 cm, 0.28 g) and compared to 55 control individuals that were handled and anesthetized but not tagged. Fish ranged between 14 and 19.1 cm in total length (TL) and the tag burden for implanted fish was 1.3\textendash 2.6\% body weight. Fish growth was estimated 15 and 30 days after tagging. Swimming behavior was assessed at 2, 7, 12, 21 and 26 days post-tagging using video tracking. All fish were also tagged with Radio Frequency Identification microtags (RFID microtags) to allow individual recognition during the trial. After one month of rearing, survival and tag retention rate of dummy-tagged fish were both 98\%. Tag implantation had no effect on length or weight either 15 or 30 days after tagging. Specific growth rate was influenced positively by fish initial weight 15 days after tagging but this influence disappeared by day 30. Under stress, swimming performance was influenced by tagging: during stressful swim treatments, dummy-tagged fish moved greater distances and had higher swimming speeds at 12 days after tagging. Also, their swimming paths were straighter at 21 days after tagging compared to the pre-stress behavior. RFID microtag loss probability was 22.6\% for control and 46.9\% for dummy-tagged fish; RFID microtag loss was influenced by surgeon on dummy-tagged fish. These results suggest that loss rate of RFID microtags is acceptable when applied alone on juveniles of this species but the tagging procedure should be improved. Implantation of miniature acoustic transmitters can be successfully applied to young sturgeons as small as 14 cm TL and 10.7 g taking into account a possible higher sensitivity to stress during the first 21 days after surgery.},

In MgMn-LDO activated peroxymonosulfate (PMS) system, 97.1\% of TC was degraded within 20 min. The high oxidizing sites exposed on MgMn-LDO surface played a main role on activating PMS to generate OH, SO4-, O2- and 1O2 (the key species) for TC degradation. MgMn-LDO could keep excellent degradation performance in a wide range of pH (from 4 to 10). The degradation degree of TC in distilled water is basically the same as that in Pearl River water, and even above 80\% of TC could be degraded in human urine. The good reusability and high structure stability of MgMn-LDO were further verified. Meanwhile, Cd immobilization on MgMn-LDO reached equilibrium within 10 min, and its maximum fixed quantity was 8.234 mmol g-1 (922.208 mg g-1). The outstanding Cd fixed ability resulted from the formation of CdCO3 and Cd (OH)2. In combined system, the existence of TC promoted the immobilization of Cd on MgMn-LDO. Low concentration of Cd (0.0125 mM) had synergism effect on TC degradation, while high concentration of Cd (0.025 and 0.05 mM) had inhibiting action. Finally, a column filled with MgMn-LDO was designed for repairing TC and Cd pollution hierarchically. This study provided an effective strategy to clean up the organic-heavy metal combined pollution.},

Elemental signatures of otoliths and pectoral fin rays effectively provide life-history information on individual fish, important for management of grayling, and potentially all freshwater teleosts. Bulk elemental signatures measured in the otoliths and fin rays were highly correlated to the stream chemistries where the fish were captured. A surprising result of this study was that fin rays showed the strongest relationship with water chemistry for strontium. Scale strontium concentrations were not correlated to water chemistries suggesting that other physiological mechanisms, or remobilisation, may be influencing the deposition of trace elements within scales. Linear discriminant function analyses for otolith and fin ray elemental signatures (and intriguingly also for scales) separated fish from different rivers for all three structures; thus, this technique can be used effectively as a means to discriminate origin of capture. \textcopyright{} 2007 The Authors Journal compilation 2007 Blackwell Munksgaard.},

  abstract = {The sturgeon species are a flagship species of the Danube River Basin that acts like an indicator of ecological health. They are protected by several international conventions (CITES, Habitats Directive, the Bern Convention and the Bonn Convention) and are assessed as endangered by the IUCN. Starting from 2011 the National Institute for Research and Development in Environmental Protection (INCDPM) Bucharest has carried monitoring of the Lower Danube River's sturgeon species using acoustic telemetry to quantify the pressures they face, their migration routes and behavior. The Institute employed local fisherman for scientific fishing practices and deployed its specialists for the in situ tagging procedures. As poaching is a constant threat to the sturgeon's wellbeing, the price offered per kilo of catch has steadily increased over time in order to highlight scientific fishing as a viable alternative. All the specimens that were captured were safely released back into the wild following a well-defined protocol that minimized stress during procedures. The distribution by species was as follows: 49.65\% Stellate sturgeons, 28.18\% Beluga sturgeons, 19.17\% Sterlet sturgeons and 3 \% Russian sturgeons. Analyzing the financial data has estimated a total investment required for the current monitoring programme comprised of 123.000 EUR for the catch rewards and 328.000 EUR as equipment costs. Further estimates are needed to quantify the cost of human effort, field work and maintenance of the monitoring network. We can safely estimate that these costs would add up to more than 1.000.000 EUR. At present, INCDPM is continuing the monitoring effort resulting in a unique database that can inform the decision makers of the actual conservation state of the sturgeon species so that the appropriate conservation measures can be taken.},

To predict accurately the environmental characteristics at the time of calcification, it is important to understand the influence of exposure time on elemental incorporation. We examined the effect of enhanced ambient strontium:calcium (Sr:Ca) (2Xand 4X ambient concentrations) and different periods of exposure (2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 d) on Sr:Ca uptake and incorporation into fish otoliths of the black bream Acanthopagrus butcheri (family: Sparidae). Sr:Ca ratios (hereafter referred to as concentrations) in bream otoliths increased with increasing ambient concentrations, with the amount of Sr:Ca incorporated into otoliths being positively affected by the period of exposure. Saturation of Sr:Ca in otoliths occurred after 20 d of exposure. Importantly, by measuring multiple variables of elemental uptake and incorporation, the relative effect of enhanced concentration and exposure time can be separated, which to date has not been possible. This research will allow for greater accuracy when interpreting environmental histories of fish.},

  abstract = {All six sturgeon species naturally occurring in the Danube River from the Black Sea (BS) to the upstream reaches in Germany today are under severe pressure and classified as either vulnerable, critically endangered or already extinct in the Danube River Basin (DRB). This sharp decline of populations is the result of two major drivers: habitat alteration and unsustainable harvest. The Danube River Basin can be divided in three functionally separated sections by its hydromorphology and character: The Lower Danube (LD) and BS, now also separated ecologically from the Middle Danube (MD) by two hydropower stations at the Iron Gate gorge, 800~km from the sea, currently restricting the remaining anadromous sturgeon species (A.~gueldenstaedtii, A.~stellatus, Huso huso) to the LD and BS also restraining migrations of potamodromous species. The Upper Danube (UD) is nowadays disconnected from the approx. 850~km long MD by Gab\v{c}ikovo Dam. The UD itself, as well as many tributaries along the Danube, are fragmented by numerous barriers, leaving no more than a total of 300~km free flowing river out of 700~km. Overharvest led to disappearance of most sturgeon species in the UD already in the Middle Ages, with populations in the MD following in the subsequent centuries. Today the potamodromous sterlet (A.~ruthenus) still exists in small decreasing populations in the UD and MD basins, where its occurrence is supported by stocking. Most probably the potamodromous ship sturgeon (A.~nudiventris) is extirpated in the whole basin. The Danube basin comprises 19 countries, being the most international river basin in the world, rendering coordinated conservation efforts a challenge. Strategic guidelines for the conservation of the Danube sturgeons are available in form of several action plans, but implementation remains insufficient as of yet. This paper attempts an analysis of the potential for sturgeon restoration in the UD and MD basin and highlights the need for concerted approaches when it comes to ex situ actions and reintroductions.},

Two relationships appear highly correlated, Sr/Cacarb and Sr/Cawater, and Mn/Cacarb and temperature. Ba/Cacarb correlated strongly with Ba/Cawater in one shell but temperature in another shell yielding inconclusive results. Mn/Cacarb and Mg/Cacarb were not strongly correlated with elemental ratios in the water, but Mn/Cacarb did show variable, weak to moderate correlation with pH. We found consistent partition coefficient (DMe) values between individual shell samples grown in the same water with mean DMg = 0.0006, DMn = 17, DBa = 0.13, and DSr = 0.176. Sr/Cacarb and Sr/Cawater exhibited the strongest, most consistent correlation with partitioning coefficients that were consistent with published values, suggesting Sr/Cacarb can be used as a proxy for Sr/Cawater in freshwater mussels.},

Elasticity analysis is a means of assessing changes to {$\lambda$} resulting from conservation initiatives. The elasticity of {$\lambda$} to survival has a characteristic profile that includes a plateau of high elasticity values across the young of the year and the juvenile ages. However, survival elasticity falls at maturity and declines rapidly with increasing adult age. Changes to fecundity have relatively little impact; the total of the fecundity elasticities over all ages is equal to the single young-of-the-year survival elasticity. Even though the young-of-the-year survival elasticity is equal to that of any other juvenile age, the overall opportunity for affecting {$\lambda$} is strongest in the young-of-the-year age-class because of its exceptional potential for increase to survival. The juvenile and adult stages have roughly equal total survival elasticities. These findings are particularly relevant in understanding the contributions of hatcheries, harvest regulations and habitat restoration as strategies for sturgeon conservation. Hatcheries are focused on the young of the year, the demographically most sensitive component of sturgeon life histories, and thus have the potential to make significant increases to {$\lambda$} if the genetic, evolutionary and ecological impacts of hatcheries can be controlled. Harvest, even at low levels, can have a significant negative impact on {$\lambda$} when it affects multiple age classes. Managers can use elasticity analysis to calculate the total impact of harvest and to mathematically evaluate the trade-off in exploiting young versus older individuals. Habitat restoration strategies, usually assessed in terms of survivals of the age classes impacted, would also benefit from using elasticity analysis to interpret their contributions to {$\lambda$}. If restoration efforts target the survival of age classes with high elasticities, significant population growth may be achieved. \textcopyright{} 2002 by the American Fisheries Society.},

  abstract = {Charismatic megafauna species may act as both flagship and umbrella species. They influence local environments and biotas, determine related ecosystem processes and functions, and are associated with high levels of biodiversity. However, the intrinsic characteristics of megafauna species including long lifespan, large body size, sparseness and/or rarity, late maturity, and low fecundity, as well as high market value, make them very prone to extinction. Up to now, scientific interest and conservation efforts have mainly focused on terrestrial and marine megafauna, while freshwater species have received comparatively little attention, despite evidence suggesting that freshwaters are losing species faster than marine or terrestrial realms. The high susceptibility of freshwater megafauna to multiple threats, coupled with immense human pressure on freshwater ecosystems, places freshwater megafauna amongst the most threatened species globally. The main threats include overexploitation, dam construction, habitat degradation, pollution, and species invasion. These threats increase mortality, decrease productivity, and reduce fitness, causing the decline of populations and the extinction of freshwater megafauna species. Given the essential ecological and biological roles of freshwater megafauna, further research should focus on their distribution patterns, extinction risks, and population dynamics, thereby improving the knowledge base for conservation planning. Finally, freshwater megafauna-based conservation strategies may raise public awareness for freshwater conservation and therefore benefit a broader range of freshwater species and functions.

  abstract = {Amazonian fishes employ diverse migratory strategies, but the details of these behaviours remain poorly studied despite numerous environmental threats and heavy commercial exploitation of many species. Otolith microchemistry offers a practical, cost-effective means of studying fish life history in such a system. This study employed a multi-method, multi-elemental approach to elucidate the migrations of five Amazonian fishes: two 'sedentary' species (Arapaima sp. and Plagioscion squamosissimus), one 'floodplain migrant' (Prochilodus nigricans) and two long-distance migratory catfishes (Brachyplatystoma rousseauxii and B. filamentosum). The Sr : Ca and Zn : Ca patterns in Arapaima were consistent with its previously observed sedentary life history, whereas Sr : Ca and Mn : Ca indicated that Plagioscion may migrate among multiple, chemically distinct environments during different life-history stages. Mn : Ca was found to be potentially useful as a marker for identifying Prochilodus's transition from its nursery habitats into black water. Sr : Ca and Ba : Ca suggested that B. rousseauxii resided in the Amazon estuary for the first 1.5\textendash 2 years of life, shown by the simultaneous increase/decrease of otolith Sr : Ca/Ba : Ca, respectively. Our results further suggested that B. filamentosum did not enter the estuary during its life history. These results introduce what should be a productive line of research desperately needed to better understand the migrations of these unique and imperilled fishes.},

Fishes are critical to ecosystem function in the Amazon River basin but face increasing anthropogenic threats. The basic biology of these species, particularly migratory behavior, remains poorly studied, in part due to the difficulty associated with conducting tagging studies in remote tropical regions. 2. Otolith microchemistry can circumvent logistical issues and is an increasingly important tool for studying fish life histories. However, this approach is still new in the Amazon, and its potential and limitations to inform fish conservation strategies remain unclear. 3. Here, otolith microchemistry studies in the Amazon are reviewed, highlighting current possibilities, and several key factors that limit its use as a conservation tool in the Amazon are discussed. These include the dearth of spatiotemporal elemental data, poor understanding of environment\textendash fish\textendash otolith pathways, and insufficient funding, facilities, and equipment. Then, a research initiative is proposed to harness the potential of this technique to support conservation in the Amazon. For Peer Review 4. Key aspects of the proposal include recommendations for internal and external funding, which are critical to acquiring and maintaining technical staff, cutting-edge equipment, and facilities, as well as fostering regular scientific meetings and working groups.

  abstract = {A three-dimensional primitive equation model including sea ice thermodynamics and air-sea interaction is used to study seasonal circulation and water mass variability in the Caspian Sea under the influence of realistic mass, momentum and heat fluxes. River discharges, precipitation, radiation and wind stress are seasonally specified in the model, based on available data sets. The evaporation rate, sensible and latent heat fluxes at the sea surface are computed interactively through an atmospheric boundary layer sub-model, using the ECMWF-ERA15 re-analysis atmospheric data and model generated sea surface temperature. The model successfully simulates sea-level changes and baroclinic circulation/mixing features with forcing specified for a selected year. The results suggest that the seasonal cycle of wind stress is crucial in producing basin circulation. Seasonal cycle of sea surface currents presents three types: cyclonic gyres in December-January; Eckman south-, south-westward drift in February-July embedded by western and eastern southward coastal currents and transition type in August-November. Western and eastern northward sub-surface coastal currents being a result of coastal local dynamics at the same time play an important role in meridional redistribution of water masses. An important part of the work is the simulation of sea surface topography, yielding verifiable results in terms of sea level. The model successfully reproduces sea level variability for four coastal points, where the observed data are available. Analyses of heat and water budgets confirm climatologic estimates of heat and moisture fluxes at the sea surface. Experiments performed with variations in external forcing suggest a sensitive response of the circulation and the water budget to atmospheric and river forcing.},

Elasmobranch vertebrae provide an analogous, yet largely underexploited component to quantify patterns of population structure in cartilaginous fishes. We quantified multi-element vertebral profiles in bronze whaler sharks Carcharhinus brachyurus from 3 regions in South Australia using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. We used multiple approaches to examine short-(months) and long-(lifetime, years) term perspectives of element incorporation. Boosted regression trees showed that variation in multi-element concentrations at the vertebral edge (representative of the time near capture) was explained primarily by spatial and shark length-based differences. An integrated lifetime elemental signal was similarly influenced by spatial differences and shark length. Cluster analyses of detrended elemental profiles across vertebrae indicated that movement patterns were highly individualistic, reflecting the mobile behaviour of this cosmopolitan species. Differentiation among sampling regions within South Australia suggests that current state-based management appears appropriate. However, when these findings are considered with existing telemetry and molecular genetic data on population structure for the species, it is likely that there is high connectivity throughout the species' range, and cooperation among management jurisdictions should be explored. More broadly, using multiple approaches to element analysis and the integration of methods (such as telemetry, genetics and chemistry) that vary in their representative temporal and spatial breadths will aid in quantifying the population structure and movement behaviour of sharks.},

At that time, only 2 abundance estimates of the Atlantic sturgeon population were available: one from commercial fisheries landings in the Hudson River ending in 1995 and one from mark-recapture research in the Altamaha River, Georgia, in 2004 and 2005. In 2013, we verified spawning in the York River, Virginia, system and initiated a multiple-year mark-recapture study focusing on spawning-run abundance. We used a Schumacher-Eschmeyer model and Program CAPTURE to produce estimates of annual spawning abundances from 2013 to 2018. The Schumacher-Eschmeyer estimates of spawning-run abundance with 95\% confidence intervals from 2013 to 2018 were 75 (31-190), 157 (115-244), 184 (150-238), 222 (137-576), 212 (157-328), and 145 (89-381), respectively. Because Atlantic sturgeon do not spawn every year, the trends in estimates do not suggest a recovering or declining population, but rather variability in proportions of the adult population that return to spawn each year. The estimates produced in Program CAPTURE using M0 (null), Mt (Chao Mt and Darroch), Mh (Chao Mh and Jackknife), and Mth (Chao Mth) models all produced similarly reliable estimates. The models that consider a behavioral response to initial capture (Mb, Mbh, and Mtb) failed to produce reliable estimates for these data, likely because as an endangered species, the dataset for Atlantic sturgeon was sparse. The Jackknife equation (model Mh) was the most precise every year with reliable accuracy and therefore is recommended.},

The use of this technique in stock discrimination requires that a number of assumptions must be met, including that groups of interest possess characteristic and reproducible markers and all possible groups contributing to the group mixture have been characterized. In some instances, structural chemistry can permit observation of subtle population structure that may not be detected by genetic applications alone.

  abstract = {The Baltic Sea contains the world's largest anthropogenic deoxygenated zone, with increasing episodes and areal extent of hypoxia/anoxia. Atlantic cod in the Baltic has suffered a loss in condition which has been attributed mainly to hypoxia. Otoliths, the aragonitic structures that form part of the hearing/balance system in fishes, accumulate Mn in the presence of hypoxia and other reducing environments. Otoliths grow over the lifetime of fishes, and thus life-long records of hypoxia exposure exist for each individual fish. However, otolith Mn/Ca ratios are also sensitive to growth effects. We tested a new proxy to at least partially account for growth: Mn/Mg, since Mg levels reflect metabolic activity but not hypoxia. This and other elemental proxies were parsed annually from the otoliths to reconstruct lifetime histories of mean, maximum, and cumulative values of this proxy as well as others (Sr/Ca) that inform us about salinity conditions. We analyzed cod from five different time periods: Neolithic (4500 YBP, a normoxic baseline), 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s - under different hypoxia intensities, assessing fish growth and condition in relation to hypoxia experience recorded by otolith proxies. Fish growth decreased with increasing hypoxia exposure; condition at capture (measured by Fulton's K index) showed a strongly positive relation to growth indexed by magnesium (Mg/Ca). We conclude that cod otolith chemistry proxies not only inform about the hypoxia, growth, and metabolic status of cod, retrospectively throughout life, but also reflect the worsening situation for cod in the Baltic.},

  abstract = {Biomineral chemistry is frequently used to infer life history events and habitat use in fishes; however, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Here we have taken a multidisciplinary approach to review the current understanding of element incorporation into biomineralized structures in fishes. Biominerals are primarily composed of calcium-based derivatives such as calcium carbonate found in otoliths and calcium phosphates found in scales, fins and bones. By focusing on non-essential life elements (strontium and barium) and essential life elements (calcium, zinc and magnesium), we attempt to connect several fields of study to synergise how physiology may influence biomineralization and subsequent inference of life history. Data provided in this review indicate that the presence of non-essential elements in biominerals of fish is driven primarily by hypo- and hyper-calcemic environmental conditions. The uptake kinetics between environmental calcium and its competing mimics define what is ultimately incorporated in the biomineral structure. Conversely, circannual hormonally driven variations likely influence essential life elements like zinc that are known to associate with enzyme function. Environmental temperature and pH as well as uptake kinetics for strontium and barium isotopes demonstrate the role of mass fractionation in isotope selection for uptake into fish bony structures. In consideration of calcium mobilisation, the action of osteoclast-like cells on calcium phosphates of scales, fins and bones likely plays a role in fractionation along with transport kinetics. Additional investigations into calcium mobilisation are warranted to understand differing views of strontium, and barium isotope fractionation between calcium phosphates and calcium carbonate structures in fishes.},

There is an urgent need to conclude the International Agreement between Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Iran on the conservation, reproduction and rational exploitation of the Caspian sturgeon. The bases for this agreement must be (1) recognition of the fact that sturgeon populations are sustained by an ecosystem that comprises the entire Caspian Sea and the rivers that flow into it (primarily the Volga); (2) an absolute ban on uncontrolled fishing for sturgeon in the sea, and (3) that national fishing quotas must reflect the real contribution of a particular state to overall sturgeon stocks.

  abstract = {Migratory fishes are natural wonders. For many people, the term migratory fish evokes images of salmon audaciously jumping at waterfalls as they return to their own riverine birthplace to spawn after years of growth in the ocean, but freshwater fishes actually show a broad spectrum of migration strategies. Migratory fishes include small species \textendash{} three-spined sticklebacks that spawn in coastal streams around the northern Pacific and gobies that move from the ocean into tropical island streams by climbing waterfalls (McDowall, 1988) \textendash{} as well as some of the largest freshwater fishes in the world, such as the Mekong dog-eating catfish and the Chinese paddlefish (Stone, 2007). Aside from migratory habits, these species have few shared characteristics; they encompass numerous evolutionary lineages, enormous differences in life history, and every possible direction and distance of migration. Biologists treat migratory freshwater fishes as a functional group because their life-history strategy revolves around long-distance movement between ecosystems in a perilous quest to take advantage of both high-quality breeding sites and bountiful feeding areas. As humans have physically blocked fish migrations, degraded breeding and feeding grounds and relentlessly harvested migrants for their flesh and roe, many populations have declined or been extirpated. This chapter will provide an overview of fundamental and applied research that is helping to guide efforts to conserve migratory freshwater fishes. For practical purposes, we define migratory behaviour as the synchronized movement of a substantial proportion of a population between distinct habitats, which is repeated through time within or across generations. Modern definitions of fish migrations typically recognise both the adaptive benefits of migrating and individual variation in executing the general strategy (see McDowall, 1988; Lucas \& Baras, 2001). Not every individual must move, the timing may vary somewhat from year to year, and the motive for migrating may include seeking refuge from harsh conditions in addition to breeding and feeding. Nonetheless, in most cases, migration is critical to individual fitness and population persistence because it enables specialised use of different habitats for growth and reproduction. Where their migration routes are blocked or key habitats are lost, migratory fishes often suffer rapid and catastrophic losses. Human appropriation and degradation of the earth's freshwater ecosystems (V\"or\"osmarty et al., 2010; Carpenter et al., 2011) have transformed this reliance on multiple habitats into a detriment for many migratory fishes. Historically, travelling spectacular distances along the same routes swum by their ancestors was sufficiently advantageous to give rise to migrations of over 1400 km among salmon in the Snake River of the USA, whitefish in the Omul River of Russia, sturgeon in Europe's Danube River, and various catfishes in Asia's Mekong River and South America's Amazon River (McKeown, 1984; Lucas \& Baras, 2001). Today, these extreme migrants are especially vulnerable to changes in environmental conditions specifically because their long-distance movements expose them to many risks. Barriers and habitat loss have reduced many migratory fish populations, and even entire species. Emblematic cases include the sturgeons and paddlefishes \textendash{} an ancient lineage of which all extant species appear on the IUCN's Red List of endangered species (Pikitch et al., 2005) \textendash{} as well as numerous salmon populations along the coasts of North America and Europe that now depend on stringent protections to avoid extirpation (Parrish et al., 1998; Ruckelshaus et al., 2002). The growing literature on declines of migratory fishes across the world suggests that a conservation crisis point is at hand, meriting urgent attention (Chapter 1). The thesis of this chapter is that conserving migratory fishes is a global challenge that requires balancing numerous biological, social and economic factors. This scenario is not unique to fishes (Wilcove \& Wikelski, 2008), but river networks impose special constraints on conservation approaches. Unfortunately, scientific research has long focused on just a handful of migratory fishes. Pioneering books on fish migrations dealt primarily with salmon, eels, shad and sturgeon (e.g., Meck, 1916; Hasler, 1966; Harden Jones, 1968), and taxonomic and geographic coverage have expanded only in the last few decades (e.g., McKeown, 1984; McDowall, 1988; Lucas \& Baras, 2001). Similarly, conservation and management efforts have focused disproportionately on a modest number of high-profile migratory taxa such as salmon and sturgeons (e.g. Ruckelshaus et al., 2002; Landsman et al., 2011), while far more species remain obscure despite their imperillment. Economically valuable migrants can sometimes serve as umbrella species whose conservation will also improve the prospects for other migratory fishes (e.g., Limburg \& Waldman, 2009), but many regions are losing migrations quietly without the benefit of such rallying-point species. We will begin with an overview of the range of migratory strategies and the diversity of freshwater fishes that migrate. With this broad perspective in mind, we will discuss the conservation predicament created by losses of both key habitats and the connections among them. We will then explore some of the ramifications of declining migrations for metapopulation dynamics, ecosystem processes and human fisheries. Finally, we will discuss some key practical considerations that complicate conservation efforts, including cost-efficiency of restoring connectivity, societal demand for new dams and roads that create barriers, risks of species invasions and contaminant transport, and the tendency to focus on economically valuable species. An exhaustive review of any one of these topics is beyond the scope of this chapter; our goal is to introduce a variety of viewpoints on the challenge of conserving migratory freshwater fishes.},

  abstract = {Worldwide, sturgeons (Acipenseridae) are among the most endangered fishes due to habitat degradation, overfishing, and inherent life history characteristics (long life span, late maturation, and infrequent spawning). As most sturgeons are anadromous, a considerable portion of their life history occurs in estuarine and marine environments where they may encounter unique threats (e.g., interception in non-target fisheries). Of the 16 marine-oriented species, 12 are designated as Critically Endangered by the IUCN, and these include species commercially harvested. We review important research tools and techniques (tagging, electronic tagging, genetics, microchemistry, observatory) and discuss the comparative utility of these techniques to investigate movements, migrations, and life-history characteristics of sturgeons. Examples are provided regarding what the applications have revealed regarding movement and migration and how this information can be used for conservation and management. Through studies that include Gulf (Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi) and Green Sturgeon (A. medirostris), we illustrate what is known about well-studied species and then explore lesser-studied species. A more complete picture of migration is available for North American sturgeon species, while European and Asian species, which are among the most endangered sturgeons, are less understood. We put forth recommendations that encourage the support of stewardship initiatives to build awareness and provide key information for population assessment and monitoring.},

Producers of coveted black caviar, sturgeons are one of the most valuable wildlife commodities on earth. The group is among the most endangered fishes with all species listed under Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) Appendix I (two species) or II (25 species), only two species considered Lower Risk by IUCN, four of the nine US taxa and one Caspian species protected under the Endangered Species Act, and local extinctions recorded for 19 of 27 species. Despite their well-publicized imperilled status, commercial pressure on 15 species persists. Here, after reviewing the biological characteristics of sturgeons and paddlefishes and their commercial use, an overview of global fisheries is presented. The synopsis demonstrates that, with few exceptions, sturgeon and paddlefish are imperilled across the globe and long-term survival in the wild is in jeopardy. All major sturgeon fisheries have surpassed peak productivity levels, with 70\% of major fisheries posting recent harvests {$<$}15\% of historic peak catches and 35\% of the fisheries examined crashing within 7-20 years of inception. Even in Caspian Sea fisheries, the most important globally, present catches are below 10\% of historic peak landings. Improved domestic and international fisheries management and attention to habitat and species restoration is now needed. Although captive rearing offers promise for caviar alternatives and endangered species restoration, it must advance cautiously to avoid environmental harm. To ensure a continued supply of caviar and the survival of these unique fishes we offer recommendations for priority conservation action for the future. \textcopyright{} 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {Lake sturgeon are arguably the largest and most unique freshwater fish in North America. Unfortunately their uniqueness includes many characteristics that make them especially vulnerable to anthropogenic impacts including overfishing, habitat fragmentation, and degradation. For approximately 100 years lake sturgeon populations across North America have either been in decline and (or) have experienced a sluggish recovery. While this is partly due to lake sturgeon life history, most researchers agree that habitat fragmentation and degradation are currently the highest risk to the species. Though most lake sturgeon populations are depressed, there are a few exceptions that offer a glimpse into what a stable population or recovery may look like. The following review highlights such instances as well as what is known and more importantly what is not known about this unique species. Specifically, we highlight the need for improved and organized sharing of raw data given the fact that many researchers do not have access to the plethora of information available to others (e.g., otoliths for aging). We examine the varying life history and diet choices of this plastic species offering hypotheses for differences in migration routes and distances as well the differing recovery rates found across their range. We highlight myths about the species providing evidence that they may not be as long lived and fecund as previously thought. We examine the lake sturgeons current legal status across North America including the efforts of nonprofit groups that have had success in increasing population numbers. Most importantly, we highlight logistical problems faced by researchers and data gaps in the literature that must be filled to increase the odds of a successful recovery. Alongside the data gaps, the recovery of this species is fraught with political and industrial road blocks that are as varied as its current recovery. Subsequently, as is the case with many species, its survival will come down to solid scientific knowledge and the value placed on it by society.},

  abstract = {The Caspian Sea is home to 1354 plants and animals and more than 122 fish species. The bulk of the remaining stocks of the world sturgeon resources is located here and provides another unique feature of the Caspian Sea, where 80-90\% of the world caviar is produced. The total official sturgeon landings in the Caspian Sea have, however, faced drastic fluctuations and decreased from 28.5 thousand tonnes in 1985 to 1345 tonnes in 2005. Illegal catch and poaching are considered to be among the main reasons for such drastic stock declines that were partly recorded between the past two world wars but occurred most dramatically with the collapse of the former Soviet Union and breaking up of joint resource management in the Caspian Sea. In 1992, the Commission of Aquatic Bioresources of the Caspian Sea was established with the objective to develop a strategy for the rational use of shared resources and also implementation of a joint programme for conservation of unique resources. In 1997, all sturgeon species were included into the CITES appendices (COP-10, Harare) and its implementation started from April 1998 onward. Several joint programmes were developed for sturgeon stock assessment, establishment of sturgeon catch and export quota and joint programmes for the conservation and management of sturgeon resources. At the same time, several International organizations such as UNDP, FAO, European Commission (Eu/Tacis) and World Bank tried to develop a regional programme to improve the present resource situation. Despite all agreements, regulations and efforts, the problems remained unsolved and sturgeon resources still face severe reductions. If the present unsatisfactory regional and international management schemes of the sturgeon resources continues without major improvements, most sturgeon species of the Caspian Sea will be extinct in the very near future. \textcopyright{} 2006 Blackwell Verlag, Berlin.},

The results show that their natural reproduction in the Volga\textendash Caspian basin has declined drastically during the past decades under the impact of (a) fluctuations of the Caspian Sea level and flow discharge from the Volga River, (b) blockage of sturgeon migration routes and loss of spawning sites because of dam construction, (c) water pollution in the lower reaches of the Volga River and in the Caspian Sea, and (d) intensive and selective illegal and unreported fishing.

Region-specific differences in otolith chemistry were observed, and notable differences in several influential markers (Mn:Ca, Sr:Ca, and Ba:Ca ratios and {$\delta$}18O) were present, particularly between the most distant regions investigated (Texas/Louisiana and SW Florida). Distinct regional signatures were observed for Warsaw grouper across 3 life history stages: first year (otolith core), most recent years (otolith edge), and lifetime (whole otolith), suggesting that individuals within certain regions share common environmental histories that may represent unique contingents or sub-populations. Findings also demonstrate that spatial variability within these markers was consistent enough to overcome any temporal variability within the geographic domains investigated for all 3 life history stages, highlighting their potential value for assessing the natal origin, exchange, and population structure of this species and potentially other members of the deepwater fish assemblage.},

  abstract = {Selected enigmas in sturgeon life history are examined based on analysis of the Gulf sturgeon population in the Suwannee River, Florida, and on scientific literature for other sturgeon species. Population structure data from 14 years of Gulf sturgeon sampling yield new insights into sturgeon life history, revealing general parallels with other sturgeons. The enigma of sturgeon fasting, particularly fasting in freshwater by anadromous species, is considered. Fasting is hypothesized as a mechanism to maintain optimum ecological body size in fishes with enormous growth potential and indeterminate ultimate size. The apparent mystery of juveniles participating in the spawning immigration of adults in anadromous species is resolved in the context of the evolution of sturgeons as fundamentally freshwater fishes. Freshwater habitat is a physiological and predator refuge during fasting intervals. The myth of great age as typical of sturgeon populations is evaluated and found to be contradicted by analysis of Gulf sturgeon length and age data, and by comparative literature data for other well-studied sturgeon species. The myth of population stability is similarly contradicted by long-term length/age frequency data for Gulf sturgeon, and is unsupported by additional long-term population analyses reported for other sturgeon species. Potential sturgeon management and conservation actions should be re-evaluated in the light of revised life history knowledge. In particular, it is important to apply the knowledge that adult females typically do not live as long as anecdote and conventional myth suggest. In fact, relative to age at first maturity, most sturgeon populations appear to be dominated by young adults; very large and very old fish are rare. Consequently, there is a low probability in natural sturgeon populations of many successive spawnings over the lifespan of any given female. It is also important to recognize the dynamic instability of sturgeon populations, rapid population recovery is improbable, even in well protected populations, given that strong year-classes are widely separated periodic phenomena in natural sturgeon populations.},

These two elemental ratios were measured in the otoliths of the European eels (Anguilla anguilla L.) using femtosecond laser ablation linked to an ICP-MS (fs-LA-ICP-MS). There was a direct relationship between the elemental ratios recorded in eel otoliths and those found in water from fresh and marine areas, suggesting that Sr:Ca and Ba:Ca ratios in eel otoliths can be used as markers of habitat in this estuary. Continuous profiling allowed the determination of three behaviour patterns in terms of habitat: freshwater, estuary and migratory individuals. Finally, the above results support the simultaneous use of both ratios for a better understanding of the migratory contingents and also as a relevant method to avoid a misidentification of environmental migratory history due to the presence of vaterite crystal in the otolith matrix. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Trace element : calcium ratios within daily increments measured by laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) are often used in fisheries science to reconstruct environmental histories. There is, however, considerable uncertainty as to which elements are interacting with either the proteinaceous or calciferous zones of the otolith, and thus their utility as indicators of environmental change. To answer this, we used size exclusion chromatography-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (SEC-ICP-MS) of endolymph, the otolith growth medium, to determine the binding interactions for a range of elements. In addition, we used solution ICP-MS to quantify element concentrations in paired otolith and endolymph samples and determined relative enrichment factors for each. We found 12 elements that are present only in the proteinaceous fraction, 6 that are present only in the salt fraction, and 4 that are present in both. These findings have important implications for the reconstruction of environmental histories based on changes in otolith elemental composition: (1) elements occurring only in the salt fraction are most likely to reflect changes in the physico-chemical environment experienced during life; (2) elements occurring only in the proteinaceous fraction are more likely to reflect physiological rather than environmental events; and (3) elements occurring in both the salt and proteinaceous fractions are likely to be informative about both endogenous and exogenous processes, potentially reducing their utility in environmental reconstructions.},

  abstract = {Otoliths are bioinorganic minerals within the inner ear of all bony fishes. They grow incrementally, laying down alternating protein-rich and mineral-rich bands daily. Consequently, otoliths are considered natural chronometers, archiving the growth and physico-chemical histories of individual fish, and thus are a powerful resource for fish biologists and fisheries managers. To date, otolith research has focused primarily on the measurement of otolith increments for age and growth studies and to a lesser extent on the analysis of trace-element:calcium ratios for reconstructing past environments. In contrast, little attention has been paid to the proteinaceous constituents of the otolith, their mechanisms of incorporation or their implications for otolith formation, growth and chemical composition. To provide a picture of the current state-of-knowledge, 228 papers relating to otolith biochemistry were reviewed, producing a comprehensive summary of the biochemistry of the endolymph, saccular epithelial tissues, and the otolith. Furthermore, this review presents a discussion of the structure and function of the 28 proteins and 5 proteoglycans identified thus far, provides comments on the appropriateness and utility of trace elements as environmental proxies, and suggests fruitful lines of future research in otolith science.},

Using a partial transcriptome for the inner ear of black bream (Acanthopagrus butcheri), in conjunction with proteomic data, we discovered hundreds of previously unknown proteins in the otolith. This allowed us to develop hypotheses to explain the mechanisms of inorganic material supply and daily formation of growth bands. We further identified a likely protein mediator of crystal nucleation and an explanation for the apparent metabolic inertness of the otolith. Due to the formation of both daily and annual increments, otoliths are routinely employed as natural chronometers, being used for age and growth estimation, fisheries stock assessments, and the reconstruction of habitat use, movement, diet and the impacts of climate change. Our findings provide an unprecedented view of otolith molecular machinery, aiding in the interpretation of these essential archived data.},

  abstract = {Although the relationship between the incorporation of an element into otoliths and the concentration of the element in water has been extensively investigated in many fish species, the interactive effects of multiple elements in water on the otolith incorporation of an element are not adequately explored or well understood. In this study, 16 treatments in triplicate using strontium (Sr; 1, 2, 3 and 4 times the ambient baseline, 6.5 mg l-1) and barium (Ba; 1, 2, 4 and 6 times the ambient baseline, 40 {$\mu$}g l-1) as categorical variables in an orthogonal design were established to evaluate the relative or interactive effects of water elements on otolith elemental incorporation in juvenile flounder Paralichthys olivaceus (from 15 to 116 days post hatching). The results revealed that otolith incorporation (Me:CaOtolith) of Sr and Ba were positively dependent on the concentrations of the elements in water (Me:CaWater). Overall, Sr was incorporated into otoliths more efficiently than was Ba, and the partition efficiency (DMe) of both elements decreased with increasing water elemental concentrations. Increasing Sr concentrations in water appeared to negatively affect the uptake of Ba into otoliths rather than facilitate it, as previously reported in fish reared in freshwater and brackish water, or showed no effect on fish in seawater. Conversely, the Ba concentration in water did not influence the otolith uptake of Sr, which agrees with the findings for other fish species. When applying otolith microchemistry to fish ecology studies, it is essential to cautiously address the interactive effects of multiple elements in the environment on otolith elemental incorporation.},

  abstract = {Microchemical analyses of fish otoliths have revolutionized fisheries science. Molecules deposited within otoliths may originate from ambient water and diet, with molecular concentrations being subject to subsequent physiological alteration after exposure. Analyses of otolith microstructure and incorporation of inorganic elements have led to major advances in stock assessment and fisheries ecology. However, the use of otoliths for microchemical analyses has drawbacks. Specifically, otolith removal from live specimens requires specimen sacrifice, which may be forbidden in the case of protected species. In addition, otoliths rarely contain sufficient concentrations of organic matter to allow reconstruction of food-web relationships via multiple stable isotopes, and otolith microstructure can be difficult to interpret in some species. Here, we review alternatives to otoliths that can provide microchemical analytes for life-history studies in fishes. Our focus is to describe advantages and disadvantages to the use of each alternative structure, with particular attention paid to trace-element analysis for inorganic matrices and stable-isotope analysis for organic ones. In general, the chronological analysis of elemental and isotopic values within each structure depends on the inert nature (or lack of molecular turnover) of the tissue. Structures with high turnover rates or those that are metabolically active will not effectively record elemental or isotopic compositions over time. Here, we provide an assessment of the use of bony endoskeleton, fin spines, fin rays, scales, and eye lenses as alternatives or complements to fish otolith analysis.},

Three of 29 Fraser River white sturgeon (10.3\% of the sample) showed significantly higher Sr fin ray concentrations in at least one annulus compared with the remainder of the fin ray, and this was interpreted as evidence of marine migrations. Eleven other individual fish had significantly higher mean Sr concentrations in their first 15 annuli compared with annuli 16-30 but lower than the concentrations of the three putative diadromous fish, and this was interpreted as evidence of time spent in the estuary. Eight Fraser River fish greater than 15 years old showed no significant increase in fin ray Sr concentations in the first 15 annuli, and Sr concentrations remained below 350 ppm throughout their lives. These individuals were considered likely to have spent most of their lives in a freshwater environment. Based on the evidence in this study, it is probable that the majority of white sturgeon in the lower Fraser River are not diadromous, but many spend extended periods of time in the Fraser River estuary as juveniles.},

Element abundances (Sr:Ca and Ba:Ca) and isotope ratios (88Sr:86Sr and 138Ba:137Ba) were quantified in water samples using solution-based inductively coupled plasmamass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and 88Sr:86Sr and 138Ba:137Ba ratios in otoliths were quantified using laser ablation ICP-MS. The relative contributions of water and food sources to otolith aragonite were assessed using a simple linear isotope mixing model. Water sources contributed 83\% of Sr and 98\% of Ba in otoliths formed in spiked seawater. Our results indicate that water chemistry is the dominant factor controlling the uptake of Sr and Ba in the otoliths of marine fishes. Thus, chemical signatures recorded in the otoliths of marine fishes should reflect the ambient water composition of these elements at the time of deposition.},

Most investigations into diadromous movement patterns have been restricted to populations in regulated rivers, and little information exists for those in unregulated catchments. We quantified movements of migratory barramundi Lates calcarifer (Bloch) in two large unregulated rivers in northern Australia using both elemental (Sr/Ba) and isotope ((87)Sr/(86)Sr) ratios in aragonitic ear stones, or otoliths. Chemical life history profiles indicated significant individual variation in habitat use, particularly among chemically distinct freshwater habitats within a catchment. A global zoning algorithm was used to quantify distinct changes in chemical signatures across profiles. This algorithm identified between 2 and 6 distinct chemical habitats in individual profiles, indicating variable movement among habitats. Profiles of (87)Sr/(86)Sr ratios were notably distinct among individuals, with highly radiogenic values recorded in some otoliths. This variation suggested that fish made full use of habitats across the entire catchment basin. Our results show that unrestricted movement among freshwater habitats is an important component of diadromous life histories for populations in unregulated systems.},

We used the t-LoCoH convex hull construction algorithm to map space use and aggregation behavior and nonmetric multidimensional scaling to test for differences among rivers, seasons, and photoperiods. Aggregation sites consisted of small core areas, where juvenile Atlantic sturgeon remained for long periods, that are adjacent to foraging grounds. This structure was largely consistent between rivers and seasons. Directional movement within aggregation sites differed between rivers. In areas of high flow velocity, directional movement was parallel to flow and largely restricted to littoral areas, whereas areas of low flow exhibited no distinct patterns in directional movement. This indicates flow may be an important driver of fine-scale distribution within aggregation sites. Studies of fine-scale space use can inform future investigations of rearing capacity, aid in the identification of critical habitat, and inform management decisions.},
