# Abstract {.unnumbered}

Chemical markers in otoliths have been used to assess the stock structure of many marine fishes, but these natural markers have yet to be widely evaluated in the spines of sturgeon fishes in the Caspian Sea, which has > 90 sturgeon stocks. We used inductively coupled–plasma mass spectrometry to quantify Ba, Cu, Mn, Zn, Li, B, Mg, Si, Fe, Sr, and Ca in pectoral fine spines of starry sturgeon (*Acipenser stellatus*) across two regions in the Caspian Sea, where depth and temperature vary from north to south. We found significant geographic variation in Mn/Ca, Cu/Ca, Zn/Ca, B/Ca, Si/Ca, Ba/Ca, and Sr/Ba. Principal component analysis and discriminant function analysis explained 78.83% and 92.5%, respectively, of the spatial variability in spine chemistry, suggesting that individuals in certain regions share common environmental histories and may represent unique stocks. Moreover, the findings suggest that pectoral fin spine chemistry can be used to identify stocks of starry sturgeon, thus providing a non-lethal approach to elucidating life-history details that are critical to the comprehensive management of sturgeon resources.

# Introduction

Anthropogenic activities threaten global fish diversity, especially among large-bodied fishes that rely on freshwater for all or part of their life histories [@allan2005; @arthington2016; @he2017; @stone2007]. Sturgeons are an ancient group of large anadromous fishes, most of which are listed as threatened or endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to overfishing and loss of habitat [@bakhshalizadeh2015; @lukyanenko1999; @pourkazemi2006; @ruban2019]. Sturgeons are highly mobile and exploit diverse habitats, which makes it challenging to delineate their stocks [@beamesderfer1997; @gross2002; @munro2007; @whitmore2018]. Moreover, sturgeon spatial distributions can be complex and extensive, varying by sex, life stage, and season [@bakhshalizadeh2017; @kahn2019; @whitmore2018a]. A clear understanding of basic life-history details, especially movement patterns, is critical for sturgeon conservation and management in the face of numerous anthropogenic pressures [@bakhshalizadeh2017; @bakhshalizadeh2012; @pikitch2005; @sulak2002].  





See Table \@ref(tab:fish-table)
In the Caspian Sea, the world’s largest inland body of water, climate change, habitat degradation, and fishing pressures threaten important fish stocks, especially those of sturgeons [@barannik2004; @lukyanenko1999; @ruban2019]. In many cases, sturgeon migrate through multinational waters, where regulation is not straightforward and fish are exposed to trawling, purse-seine fisheries and gill-nets by illegal fishermen @bakhshalizadeh2017; @friedrich2018; @friedrich2019]. Sturgeon conservation and management in the Caspian Sea requires an understanding of sturgeon migration patterns, site fidelity, and connectivity within and among stocks [@bakhshalizadeh2021; @bakhshalizadeh2015; @bakhshalizadeh2011; @mcintyre2015].

Quantifying the dispersal of stocks is essential to further our understanding of stock dynamics. Tagging and telemetry techniques are valuable for elucidating movement behavior in sturgeons but can be challenging to use in the youngest fish classes due to their small size [@carrera-garcia2017]. By contrast, natural tags allow long-term stock-identification studies across individuals of all sizes [@allen2009; @arai2002; @campana1999; @chen2019]. Calcified structures have been used as sources of natural tags in fisheries science for decades because they incorporate various trace and microelements from the ambient environment [@campana1999; @kerr2014; @tzadik2017]. Otolith microchemistry is the most widely used tool for studying natural tags because otoliths are metabolically inert [@campana1999; @thomas2019] and thus preserve life-long records of environmental exposure. However, fish are killed in the process of removing otoliths, which is clearly undesirable when studying threatened species such as sturgeons.

Fin rays and spines provide a valuable non-lethal alternative to otoliths for investigating natural tags of habitat use [@allen2009; @arai2002; @avigliano2019; @bakhshalizadeh2021a; @cadrin2005; @clarke2007; @kerr2014; @phelps2012; @tzadik2017]. The pectoral fin spines of sturgeon originate from cells within the dermis along more than half the anterior edge of the pectoral fin and are reinforced with hydroxyapatite (calcium phosphate) and collagen [@bakhshalizadeh2019; @bakhshalizadeh2013; @bakhshalizadeh2013a; @loewen2016; @tzadik2017]. Like otoliths, sturgeon pectoral spines grow in characteristic bands that can be used to study age and life history of individuals [@bakhshalizadeh2011; @pollock2015]. Although pectoral spines are not metabolically inert like otoliths, their margins are stable enough to elucidate habitat use and stocks based on natural tags [@avigliano2019; @clarke2007; @tzadik2017].

Here, we quantified a suite of microelements in pectoral fin spines of starry sturgeon, which are an important caviar species that require stocking in the Caspian Sea due to overfishing and habitat degradation [@pourkazemi2006]. We investigated fish from the northern and southern Caspian Sea, which is divided into distinct basins (north, middle and south). The northern basin is by far the shallowest, with a maximum depth of only ~20 m compared with 788 and 1,025 m, respectively, for the middle and north basins [@ibrayev2010]. The northern basin is also heavily influenced by the input of the Volga River, which accounts for about 80% of all river discharge into the Caspian Sea, resulting in a lower salinity [@ibrayev2010; @matishov2018]. These distinct environments may thus be recorded in the calcified body parts of fish, including fin spines. Our goal was to determine whether starry sturgeon from the northern and southern Caspian Sea can be differentiated using fin spine microchemistry, which would provide crucial baseline information for discriminating unique stocks.

# Material and Methods

## Sample collection and preparation

Starry sturgeon were collected in the northern and southern Caspian Sea (Figure 1) from commercial catches harvested with either beach seines (1,000–1,100 m long, 10–15 m deep, and cod-end mesh of 30–33 mm) or gill nets (18 m long, 2.1 m deep, and knot-to-knot mesh size of 100 mm). All specimens were adults, and no fish were killed specifically for this project. Starry sturgeon total length (in cm), weight (in kg), and sex (via macroscopic examination of gonads) were recorded. The right pectoral fin spine was collected from each fish and cleaned with a brush followed by an ultrasonic bath to remove soft tissues.

Spine samples were prepared and analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; 7500 Series, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) by the staff at the Aria Sharif Chemical Laboratory (Karaj, Iran). Briefly, 6 g samples of cleaned spines were immersed in a 2:1 (v/v) mixture of 65% nitric acid (HNO~3~; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and 60% perchloric acid (HClO~4~; Merck) at 70°C to totally dissolve the spines. The obtained solution was then mixed with distilled water in a sampling vial to a volume of 50 mL. ICP-MS was used to measure spine Ba, Cu, Mn, Zn, Li, B, Ca, Mg, Si, Sr, and Fe. A multi-element standard (1094870100SKU; Merck) was used for instrument calibration every five samples. The operational conditions for the ICP-MS were optimized following the manufacturer’s instructions (Table 1).

## Data analyses

All concentrations of  Ba, Cu, Mn, Zn, Li, B, Ca, Mg, Si, Sr and Fe were normalized by fish total length prior to analyses [@scuddereikenberry2015], thereby minimizing the influence of fish age [@azevedo2019]. Elemental contents were normalized relative to Ca as an internal standard. Sr/Ba was also evaluated, given its high sensitivity to transitional estuarine environments [@mcculloch2005; @walther2011]. Then all data were examined for normality and homogeneity before performing statistical analyses, and transformed where necessary [@quinn2002].

Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s post-hoc test was performed to evaluate the effects of sex and regions [@zar1996]. Elemental ratios with significant regional differences were further investigated using principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of variables and test for regional differences [@quinn2002]. Discriminant function analysis (DFA) was used to estimate the percentage of spines that could be correctly classified into their regions. Finally, Ward’s method was used as a complement to the DFA to cluster the fish. All statistical analyses were performed with using SPSS (version 15; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. SigmaPlot 2000 (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) and Excel 2014 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) were used to visualize the data.

# Results

Fin spines from a total of 40 fish were sampled (10 males and 10 females from the south, 13 male and 7 males from the north) (Table 2). Mn/Ca, Cu/Ca, Zn/Ca, B/Ca and Si/Ca in pectoral fin spines of starry sturgeons differed significantly (p < 0.05) between geographic regions (Fig. 2); fish from the southern Caspian Sea had lower Mn/Ca, Cu/Ca, Zn/Ca, and Si/Ca, but higher B/Ca, than fish from the northern Caspian Sea. In addition, the interactions between sex and geographic region were significant for Ba/Ca and Sr/Ba (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3). Pectoral fin spines of male starry sturgeons had the highest Sr/Ba values (Fig. 3). Pectoral fin spine Ba/Ca for female individuals was highest in the south, while samples from the north had values between those of female and male samples from the south (Fig. 3).

Variations in significant elemental ratios between geographic regions were reduced to three principal components using PCA (PC1 = 44.60%, PC2 = 19.38% and PC3 = 14.85%; Fig. 4 and Table 3), indicating that 78.83% of the total variation was related to Ba/Ca, Zn/Ca, Si/Ca, Sr/Ba and Mn/Ca. PC1 was influenced primarily by Ba/Ca and Zn/Ca, PC2 by Si/Ca and Sr/Ba, PC3 by Mn/Ca (Fig. 4 and Table 3).

Elemental variation between geographic regions was significant (Wilk’s lambda = 0.33, x2 = 38.10, d.f. = 8, p < 0.05); DC1 from the DFA explained 92.5% of the variation. Discrimination by cross-validated classification between these regions also showed a high degree of correct classification (85% overall; 90% of southern samples and 80% of northern samples). Ward’s method grouped the southern and northern samples into clear subgroups (Fig. 5).

# Discussion

Our analyses of starry sturgeon pectoral fin spine revealed significant variation in pectoral spine Mn/Ca, Cu/Ca, Zn/Ca, B/Ca and Si/Ca between fish from the northern and southern Caspian Sea, while PCA indicated that 78.83% of total variation was related to Ba/Ca, Zn/Ca, Si/Ca, Sr/Ba and Mn/Ca. Furthermore, classification success to specific geographic regions using elemental variation was high (85%). These results suggest that starry sturgeon populations in the northern and southern Caspian Sea likely comprise different stocks.

Recent studies have begun to reveal the complex mechanisms underlying otolith growth and composition [@hussy2020; @thomas2019a; @thomas2017; @thomas2019], indicating that many pathways exist by which microelements are incorporated. Although the pathways associated with fin spines remain unknown [@loewen2016], they are likely similar to those of otoliths. Sr and Ba in calcified structures have a relatively long history of use in elucidating fish life histories [@campana1999; @elsdon2008]. The ratios of these elements to calcium in calcified parts of fish are strongly correlated with water chemistry [@hussy2020; @walther2006] and are useful for indicating transitions from freshwater to marine water and vice versa [@hermann2016; @mcculloch2005; @tabouret2010; @walther2011]. Zn and Cu in calcified structures appear to be de-coupled from concentrations in ambient water [@hussy2020; @thomas2017]. In otoliths, they may play a physiological role as co-factors for enzymes associated with the otolith protein matrix [@thomas2017] and may therefore be indicative of fish physiology. Mn likely reflects both environmental concentrations and fish physiology [@hussy2020; @limburg2018]. The pathways by which B and Si enter calcified structures of fish remain poorly studied.

Detailed life-history parameters are not known for the fish examined in this study. However, microelements reflecting both environmental and biological factors differed regionally in starry sturgeon fin spines, suggesting fish from the northern and southern Caspian Sea differ across a suite of life-history factors, such as habitat exploitation, growth, and/or feeding. The geography of the basin likely plays a large role in these chemical differences. The northern basin is extremely shallow and influenced by the freshwater discharge of the Volga River [@ibrayev2010; @matishov2018], resulting in a large, open, shallow basin with lower salinity. By contrast, the south is characterized by a relatively narrow band of shallow coastal water surrounding a large, deep basin. Therefore, sturgeon in these two basins not only experience different chemical environments, but also likely require different feeding strategies.  Interestingly, male starry sturgeon in the southern Caspian Sea had significantly higher Sr/Ba than females, suggesting higher exposure to more saline environments [@mcculloch2005; @walther2011], and therefore important inter-sex life-history differences may also exist.

Stocking may have also influenced the observed results. Caspian Sea sturgeon stocks have been devastated by fishing and environmental degradation, and all five species are supported by artificial stocking efforts [@pourkazemi2006]. Fish stocked in Russia in the north, for example, may differ genetically, behaviorally, physiologically, etc., from those stocked in Iran in the south, in addition to being exposed to different environments. Fin spine microchemistry has been shown to vary significantly among sturgeon from different hatcheries in Iran [@bakhshalizadeh2021a], so it would not be unreasonable that even starker differences exist between fish stocked by different national authorities. This could be further complicated by differences in survivorship of stocked vs. naturally spawned fish and/or stocking rates in the north and south, especially given the environmental differences between regions.
We found that fin spine microchemistry was effective at discriminating starry sturgeon from different regions in the Caspian Sea. Elemental data suggest that starry sturgeons have different life histories in the northern and southern Caspian Sea and therefore likely represent different stocks. These results provide baseline information required for the conservation and management of these imperiled and poorly understood fish. Our study also adds to a growing body of literature demonstrating that fin spine microchemistry is a valuable, non-lethal tool for assessing the life histories of threatened fish species [@allen2009; @arai2002; @avigliano2019; @bakhshalizadeh2021a; @cadrin2005; @clarke2007; @kerr2014; @phelps2012; @tzadik2017].

Microchemistry provides a critical tool that allows scientists and managers to rapidly gather life-history data from relatively small sample sizes. However, as in other threatened and poorly understood systems, additional efforts are needed to realize the potential of this method as a conservation tool [@hermann2021]. The potential regional diversity in sturgeon life histories demonstrated here requires further study and likely management action. This includes studies of environment–fin spine pathways mediating the uptake of elements, international research and management cooperation (especially given the potentially transboundary migrations that sturgeons undertake), and fin spine studies that include all Caspian Sea sturgeon species. A broad, long-term, and international investigation of sturgeon fin spine microchemistry in the Caspian Sea could provide a research and management framework for other poorly studied regions with threatened species.
